# Elastic Secure Infrastructure

We want to create a set of services/systems to permit multiple tenants to flexibly allocate baremetal machines from a pool of available hardware, attach those systems to tenant-private networks, and to optionally provision an operating system on those systems through the use of an associated provisioning service.

## Documentation

- The [requirements document][reqs] describes the basic requirements of the ESI project.
- The [design document][design] describes how are are implementing those requirements.
- The [upstream features][upstream] document describes changes we will need to make in upstream projects to support those requirements or to allow an upstream project to take advantage of ESI.
